My typical day

06:00 - Wake up, lie in bed and catch up on the news
06:30 - Shower
06:45 - Get dressed, make coffee
07:00 - Take Charleigh coffee in bed, get the kids up and ready (they’re usually up at the same time as me, but getting them started is always a challenge first thing in the morning)
07:30 - Catch up on my emails and get busy working
09:15 - Daily standup
12:00 - Lunch.
16:30 - Generally by about this time I’m done for the day, so I start to wind down and get away from my laptop.
17:30 - Dinner
19:00 - Movie
22:30 - Bed
