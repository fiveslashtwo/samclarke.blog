Maybe this is down to aphantasia, maybe I'm just not imaginative enough for this book, but I really struggled to keep up with the story over the sheer amount of descriptive writing there is in this book. I think I liked it, I certainly loved the extensive world-building, I just felt it never really gave way to the rest of the story. I had to read this book over a long period of time just to give myself room to digest, and I think that's where this fell down a little for me.
