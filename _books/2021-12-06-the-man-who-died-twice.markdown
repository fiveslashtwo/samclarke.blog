This book takes off exactly where [The Thursday Murder Club]( __GHOST_URL__ /book/the-thursday-murder-club/) left off. I love that it focuses more solidly on the main cast and really enjoyed the continual world-building from the character's own histories. I can't wait to see how Richard Osman continues this story in the third book!
