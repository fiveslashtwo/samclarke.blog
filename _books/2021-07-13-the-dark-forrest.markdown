I read the first book in this series a little while before I started logging my book reviews here, and thought I was going to struggle for some of the detail of the first book when picking up the second. That fear was completely unfounded, this book does an incredible job of continuing where the first left off and excels the story forward in to the future. I absolutely love Cixin Liu's writing style, the depth and poetry of his prose is second to none. I cannot wait to get on to the final book of the series, and am even more pumped for the Netflix series as and when that arrives.
