It's taken me far longer to read this final installment of The Three-Body Problem than any other in the series. It is without doubt the most in-depth sci-fi I've read and the scale of the stories completely blew me away. I think there's something extra that comes across in the translation of these books from their originals which adds beautiful - almost poetic - imagery.
