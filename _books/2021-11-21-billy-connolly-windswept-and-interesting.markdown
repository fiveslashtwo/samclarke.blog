I read this entire book in a single day, on the train to London and back. I've always found Billy Connolly to be an hilarious, colourful and interesting character - that view of him has only hardened after reading his autobiography. He's led such a wonderful life, and overcome some incredible hardships. Much like Forrest Gump, he seems to have just been in the right place at the right time, very often in his life.
