This is my second attempt at reading 'Dune' and now that I've finally reached it's end I'm really pleased I stuck with the overwhelming scale of the world-building, to get in to the real depths of the story. This is a book of epic proportion which think navigates the power of empathy incredibly well. I'm really looking forward to seeing how Denis Villneuve brings this to the screen.
