As polarising a figure as he can be, I've held Jordan Peterson in fairly high regard for a while now - even more so after finishing his second book. He communicates his second set of guiding principals for life in a way which allows them to be understood at a number of levels, he does this by accompanying each rule with a parable and a Disney movie reference to drive his point home. I also love thatwe bear witness to the effect life - and it's ups and downs - has had on him over the last few years and see first hand how this changed his own approach to life.
