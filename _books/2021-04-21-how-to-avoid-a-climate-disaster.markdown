Gates gives his take on the key problems we'll face as a planet in the years to come, looks at the impact our life on the world today, and provides compelling evidence to support what he sees as our best chances of success.

There's a lot to digest here but Gates goes out of his way to find the most natural way to explain the data and science behind the years of research he's supported. This book was a pleasure to listen to and left me feeling positive about our hopes for the future.
