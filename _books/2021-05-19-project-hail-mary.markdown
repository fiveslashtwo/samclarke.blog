Andy Weir has been one of my favourite sci-fi authors for the better part of the last decade, with R. C. Bray's voicework for The Martian being what brought me in to this world. Weir's incredible attention to detail and grounded reality for his stories captivates me entirely and utterly. The only places I feel slightly let down are his endings, they come quickly and don't give much time for mourning before the book ends. In the case of Project Hail Mary, that left me satisfied and in need of more, I know this story is over, but I really hope it's not the last thing we see from the him.
