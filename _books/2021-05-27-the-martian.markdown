Reading [Project Hail Mary]( __GHOST_URL__ /book/project-hail-mary/) earlier this month left me wanting more of Andy Weir, so I dived back in to The Martian for the first time since the film was released. I suffer from aphantasia and find audiobooks the best way to aid my imagination, but was surprised to realise a lot of my memory of the book had been overwritten by the film. It was absolutely wonderful to relive this story and to refresh my memory with all the fantastic little details Weir left for us to stew over.
