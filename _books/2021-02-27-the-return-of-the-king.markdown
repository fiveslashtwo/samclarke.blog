This was an excellent end to a fantastic trilogy of books, the slow pace in the majority of [The Two Towers]( __GHOST_URL__ /book/the-two-towers/) was out-classed by the constant and imaginative storytelling of this final chaper. I was amazed both by how much of this story was successfully brought across to the screen in Peter Jackson's movies, and by how much more story there was to tell in this book. I've become completely enamoured of Tolkien's poetic use of language - his own or otherwise - and must make time to sit and read The Silmarillion.
