Last night we re-watched The Martian, this time with the kids. I absolutely love this film, we listened to the audio book in 2013 (one of the best audio books I've had the pleasure of listening to). The film adaptation doesn't disappoint, although I do with we'd seen a 'Disco Watney' poster for the film on it's release.
