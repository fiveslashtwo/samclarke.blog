The Two Towers was incredibly slow to start, but did finally progress the story before I lost interest. I really did have to work at sticking with this one a little more than the first book, but I think that's fair given where this sits in the wider trilogy. The second half picked up well and kept me gripped til the end. I think I'll be straight in to The Return of The King next.
