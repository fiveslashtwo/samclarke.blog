I love Ernest Cline's writing style. Being such a fan of Ready Player One I had high expectations for this book. Acts 1 & 2 were fantastic, but it feels like act 3 was a representation of how quickly the author had to make good on his publishing agreement rather than deliver on a good story. As the number of pages remaining decreased, the amount of story left to tell grew with the complete inverse.
