I was so excited when I heard there was going to be a follow up to Ready Player One. The first book was filled with such vivid imagery of pop-culture that it really made the story come to life. This second book is a wonderful follow up, but I think suffers slightly from how well crafted the story was in the first. I still really enjoyed this, and look forward to anything else new from Ernest Cline.
