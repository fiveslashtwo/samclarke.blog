title: Trading-off for convenience
---

I have run the majority of my life so far at pace very similar to the rate of technological change. I have sprinted headlong in to powerful new products and life-changing services, placing me vcry near to the start-line of the early adopter race. But now that I'm a fair distance from that start-line, I'm noticing perhaps I haven't paced myself particularly well.

- Sense of pride around having a simple @gmail.com address
- Desire to consolidate all services out of convenience
- Choosing wholesale between platforms & providers (apple, google, dropbox, etc.)
- Owning my data & content across the internet (instragram, blogging again)
- Trading off security and ownership for a faster pace, better position
