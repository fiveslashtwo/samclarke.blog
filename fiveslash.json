I spent a good few hours walking around the shops and even had\ntime for a drink and a look around the butterfly house!\n\nBy the time I’d finished looking around, it was time to board my final flight to\nMelbourne. In all, that was also a great flight. It was fairly empty, so I had\nthe benefit of being able to lie down properly, which was wonderful!\n\nFinally, at 6am, I landed in Australia! To start with, it didn’t feel all that\ndifferent… That said, I hadn’t slept properly for a good couple of days, so it\nwas definitely quite a lot to take in! Since landing, I’ve spent a couple of\ndays in the office, I’ve sorted out a phone, opened a bank account and I’m\ncurrently sat in my hotel after having had breakfast, waiting to go and view a\nhouse! I’m looking to view/apply for as many places as possible, in the hope of\nhaving the best chance of moving in to somewhere fairly quickly, so that when\nCharleigh and Ellie come over in July, we’re all set to go!\n\nI’ve got a ton of pictures so far, so I’ll probably upload those separately,\nthough you can see a lot of what I’m up to on the Social page\n[http://www.samuelclarke.co.uk/social]!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","updated_at":"2018-08-18 20:55:15","published_at":"2012-06-15 10:05:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5e2306b485f6f34ae4ffebd8","uuid":"7202f9ab-7e6f-4e2a-8f9c-b4170bb10073","title":"Data backup","slug":"datanbspbackup","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened&hellip; But I recently sold my Macbook Pro, before doing so I spent hours, working through all my music, videos and personal files to ensure that when I formatted the drive, I didn&rsquo;t lose anything.</p>\\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until some weeks after I sold my MBP that I realised I had not backed up iPhoto.

To our surprise the\nlittle monster measured in at 0.88cm in length, still attached to it’s yolk sack\nit doesn’t even have a discernible shape, but we could already make out it’s\nheartbeat, measuring at 130bpm.We’re told that in two weeks time, the baby will\nalready have begun growing limb-buds and just a few days after that will be a\nfully formed foetus.\n\nWhilst we do have a wonderful family already, this part of the process is\nentirely new to me and I’m really looking forward to what is going to happen\nover the coming weeks. We’re scheduled back in at the doctors tomorrow for a\nwalk through of the ultrasound scans Charleigh had, so I guess we’ll learn a\nlittle more about the next steps then.\n\nWe already have a hospital “assigned” where the baby will be born (Assuming the\npregnancy goes to the plan of both us and our doctor), so I can only imagine\nthat we’ll be taking it easy for the next few weeks before our next scan is\nbooked in so that we can find out the gender!\n\nSince we’re so early in finding a lot of this out, I think we’re both slightly\nconfused as to what we’re supposed to be doing next… It’ll be months before we\nneed to start looking at cots, moses baskets and clothing etc. but I already\nfind myself trawling around furniture and baby sites, filled with anticipation\nfor what will be happening around the beginning of May next year.\n\nBefore all of that however comes one of the most anticipated parts of pregnancy…\nPicking a name! We’ve been hypothetically talking about baby names for quite a\nwhile now, so we do have some sort of a shortlist in mind. We’re continuing to\nwork on that, but no doubt whatever name we ultimately pick (Whether that’s\nbefore or after we know the gender), is likely to be completely abandoned the\nmoment our baby is born.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","updated_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","published_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5e2306b485f6f34ae4ffebed","uuid":"739b95fd-e0ba-42c3-90fd-5f6a7a6981e4","title":"Social Commerce","slug":"socialnbspcommerce","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<p>As you may or may not know, I work in ecommerce.

It’s\nwhat my career is based on and without a drastic change in lifestyle, that’s\njust not possible. However, what I can do is make a vow to spend less time\nprocrastinating around the internet, both at my desk and on my phone, and spend\nmore time focussing on my life and the lives of my family. To kick it off,\ninstead of spending my 12 hour layover at LAX tomorrow sitting online and\nplaying with the photos and videos from my trip, I’ll be packing my laptop away\nand sitting with what is actually the first book I’ve bought in a very long\ntime.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","updated_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","published_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5e2306b485f6f34ae4ffebf6","uuid":"190efc58-8752-4f4d-93d1-cdb598b94d41","title":"Time Management","slug":"timenbspmanagement","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<p>Last week, Charleigh and I had a long conversation about the different methods of time management, ranging from personal time to work time.

It’s a complete no-brainer - It’s increased height is a huge\nadvantage for me, the small but important weight difference will be very helpful\nfor Charleigh, and the money saved is more than enough for us to buy a car-seat\n(Once we have a car, anyway).\n\nI’m glad I spent so much time working my way through viable options and now I\ncan’t wait to have the pram in my hands.

From the pre-unibody days of the Plastic Macbook to the Haswell based 2013 Macbook Air that I'm running today. They've always served me incredibly well, and for the forseeable future will remain my goto; both for work and for the heavier use that my iPad just isn't capable of supporting.  \\n\\nPrior to running the majority of my life from my wonderful Air, I actually lived without a personal computer for a couple of years (Partially a philosophical debate I was having with myself around the amount of time I spent on a computer and slightly depicted by my nomadic lifestle of the time). If I look back to the last time I built my own machine from scratch Pentium 4 was brand new (considered top of the line) and the choice for componenents, periperals and even cases was pretty limited.  \\n\\nIn the years since I last built a machine my requirements have changed rather a lot, as has the budget I might have for such a build. But with that said, I have a very specific couple of use cases in mind for the build I'm about to undertake, and have set myself a rather modest budget for the task at hand. Whilst I adore my Macbook for everything from general web browsing to the more complex daily tasks my job brings to the table, there were a few major points driving my decision to build a machine.  \\n\\n*The ability to increase storage space*  \\n\\nI have a fast growing collection of RAW photographs and the 128GB storage of my MBA just isn't enough. I don't plan on building a homeserver, but the ability to expand my storage later on is really important - As is redundancy!  \\n\\n*It would need to be small, light and quiet*\\n\\nThe most recent PC I had was really for gaming moreso than anything else, but unfortunately due to it's size, I had to dismantle and get rid of it during the move back to the UK. Given we have plans to move again in the near future, I want to make sure I don't come across the same problems as last time - The ideal way to solve this is with a Micro ATX form factor case that is easily packed or stowed.

It&rsquo;s becoming something we seem to more less frequently, but still - I relish the opportunity to get out of London, even if it&rsquo;s just for 48 hours! We &ldquo;landed&rdquo; around 10pm Friday night after an arduous journey from the far side of the M25, right up to the top of the &ldquo;eye-wateringly&rdquo; boring M40. By that time I was pretty knackered, although, Charleigh has managed to bag herself an hour or so worth of sleep, which I guess was nice for her? haha.</p>\\n<p>On Saturday, we spent most of the day relaxing&hellip; Made our way in to Worcester town (Really, not all that much of a town if I&rsquo;m honest) enjoyed a lovely hot chocolate and spent a bit of time doing some shopping. That evening we met my dad for a few drinks down ar the local watering hole before making our way to the middle of nowhere to let off a glorious collection of fireworks we&rsquo;d collected earlier in the day. My brother and I spent collectively about £60 on the typical rockets, fountains etc&hellip; it was great fun!</p>\\n<p>Sunday again, was a relaxed day, but we had a bit more structure. My mum had invited us to lunch (Including my brother and his girlfriend) who, unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t make it. Once we we all ready we headed out to a personal favourite among restaurants called &ldquo;The Crown&rdquo; at Hallow. Usually, I love this place (I use usually as a precursor to this statement in apprehension of the following statement.) the foods always been excellent, the staff are local, lovely and it&rsquo;s not overly priced given it&rsquo;s attempts to become a bit of a &ldquo;Gastro&rdquo; pub.

To our surprise the\nlittle monster measured in at 0.88cm in length, still attached to it’s yolk sack\nit doesn’t even have a discernible shape, but we could already make out it’s\nheartbeat, measuring at 130bpm.We’re told that in two weeks time, the baby will\nalready have begun growing limb-buds and just a few days after that will be a\nfully formed foetus.\n\nWhilst we do have a wonderful family already, this part of the process is\nentirely new to me and I’m really looking forward to what is going to happen\nover the coming weeks. We’re scheduled back in at the doctors tomorrow for a\nwalk through of the ultrasound scans Charleigh had, so I guess we’ll learn a\nlittle more about the next steps then.\n\nWe already have a hospital “assigned” where the baby will be born (Assuming the\npregnancy goes to the plan of both us and our doctor), so I can only imagine\nthat we’ll be taking it easy for the next few weeks before our next scan is\nbooked in so that we can find out the gender!\n\nSince we’re so early in finding a lot of this out, I think we’re both slightly\nconfused as to what we’re supposed to be doing next… It’ll be months before we\nneed to start looking at cots, moses baskets and clothing etc. but I already\nfind myself trawling around furniture and baby sites, filled with anticipation\nfor what will be happening around the beginning of May next year.\n\nBefore all of that however comes one of the most anticipated parts of pregnancy…\nPicking a name! We’ve been hypothetically talking about baby names for quite a\nwhile now, so we do have some sort of a shortlist in mind. We’re continuing to\nwork on that, but no doubt whatever name we ultimately pick (Whether that’s\nbefore or after we know the gender), is likely to be completely abandoned the\nmoment our baby is born.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","updated_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","published_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5e39340a46ec3460400849a7","uuid":"739b95fd-e0ba-42c3-90fd-5f6a7a6981e4","title":"Social Commerce","slug":"socialnbspcommerce-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<p>As you may or may not know, I work in ecommerce.

As\na result, I started to take what I felt were much better images; I don’t carry\nmy camera everywhere, that’s just impractical, but when I do I think much more\nabout how I’ll see these photos in the years to come and worry far less about\nhow other people see what I’m doing and the pictures I’m uploading.\n\nRight, back off my tangent there - I’m not planning to leave the internet. It’s\nwhat my career is based on and without a drastic change in lifestyle, that’s\njust not possible. However, what I can do is make a vow to spend less time\nprocrastinating around the internet, both at my desk and on my phone, and spend\nmore time focussing on my life and the lives of my family. To kick it off,\ninstead of spending my 12 hour layover at LAX tomorrow sitting online and\nplaying with the photos and videos from my trip, I’ll be packing my laptop away\nand sitting with what is actually the first book I’ve bought in a very long\ntime.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","updated_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","published_at":"2013-11-19 11:05:19","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5e39340a46ec3460400849b0","uuid":"190efc58-8752-4f4d-93d1-cdb598b94d41","title":"Time Management","slug":"timenbspmanagement-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<p>Last week, Charleigh and I had a long conversation about the different methods of time management, ranging from personal time to work time.

Sure the cameras have improved, processing power and speed have increased as well, but where I really feel I&rsquo;m losing out as part of the Apple eco-system is in advances in apps and third party technology. It took Apple a good few years before they changed iOS in any great way - I&rsquo;m now thinking it was too little too late.</p>\\n<p>In the time it took Apple to upgrade to iOS 7, I began to utilise and ultimately became dependant on apps like Dropbox and Spotify. Those two apps alone have been enough to essentially remove my phone from my device cycle.

It’s a complete no-brainer - It’s increased height is a huge\nadvantage for me, the small but important weight difference will be very helpful\nfor Charleigh, and the money saved is more than enough for us to buy a car-seat\n(Once we have a car, anyway).\n\nI’m glad I spent so much time working my way through viable options and now I\ncan’t wait to have the pram in my hands.

From the pre-unibody days of the Plastic Macbook to the Haswell based 2013 Macbook Air that I'm running today. They've always served me incredibly well, and for the forseeable future will remain my goto; both for work and for the heavier use that my iPad just isn't capable of supporting.  \\n\\nPrior to running the majority of my life from my wonderful Air, I actually lived without a personal computer for a couple of years (Partially a philosophical debate I was having with myself around the amount of time I spent on a computer and slightly depicted by my nomadic lifestle of the time). If I look back to the last time I built my own machine from scratch Pentium 4 was brand new (considered top of the line) and the choice for componenents, periperals and even cases was pretty limited.  \\n\\nIn the years since I last built a machine my requirements have changed rather a lot, as has the budget I might have for such a build. But with that said, I have a very specific couple of use cases in mind for the build I'm about to undertake, and have set myself a rather modest budget for the task at hand. Whilst I adore my Macbook for everything from general web browsing to the more complex daily tasks my job brings to the table, there were a few major points driving my decision to build a machine.  \\n\\n*The ability to increase storage space*  \\n\\nI have a fast growing collection of RAW photographs and the 128GB storage of my MBA just isn't enough. I don't plan on building a homeserver, but the ability to expand my storage later on is really important - As is redundancy!  \\n\\n*It would need to be small, light and quiet*\\n\\nThe most recent PC I had was really for gaming moreso than anything else, but unfortunately due to it's size, I had to dismantle and get rid of it during the move back to the UK.
