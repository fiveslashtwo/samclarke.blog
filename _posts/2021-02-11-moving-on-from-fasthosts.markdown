Today is my last day at [Fasthosts](https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/). I've been there as a Product Manager for their server and cloud products for the last 2 years and while I've had an amazing time and succeeded in all the ways I intended, it's time for me to move on to something new.

I've spent the last couple of months slowly handing over my projects and documenting as much as I can and am now feeling slightly bittersweet as I get ready to pack up my laptop and drop it off at the office.

With all the interesting stuff I've worked on, I've learned a lot in the last 2 years, met some great people and developed skills I hope will take me much further in my pursuit of something awesome.

There's a long weekend before I start my new role and plan on getting some early spring cleaning done so I can get my permanent working from home setup, completed.

Generally I've avoided writing too specifically about work on my blog, it always felt dry, unrelated and something I wanted to keep to the working hours of the day. With a renewed focus on this blog and a real fire to improve myself, I'll be including more about my new role and how I work in the future.

Thank you to everyone at Fasthosts, it's been awesome.

✌️
