Taking some inspiration from [Derek Muller](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium), [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) & [Myke Hurley](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/95) I'm writing down my goals for 2020 with the hope it'll increase my chances of actually achieving them. Trying to keep it short and to the point, I've got three goals:

### 1) Read one book each month, all year.

This might not sound a lot, but I've never read consistently, and although I have got better in the last couple of years, it's still something I drop in and out of in phases. I'm intending to find a varied mix of books which cross genre, size, and age, and have already picked my first six.

- Armada, _Ernest Cline_
- Heroes: Mortals and Monsters, Quests and Adventures, _Stephen Fry_
- Wool, _Hugh Howey_
- Atomic Habits, _James Clear_
- Brave New World, _Aldous Huxley_
- Alchemy, _Rory Sutherland_

### 2) Get running regularly, again

2017 was a great year for me, I managed to run on average 3 times a week almost all year, which is the most I've run my entire life. Last year my running fell by the wayside and I seemed to find a good excuse to not get out there almost every time I thought about it.

I'm not aiming to break any records (although that would be nice), instead I just want to make running a part of my routine and go from there.

### 3) Make time

I've found recently I've become far too absorbed in sitting endlessly scrolling through Instagram, Reddit and Twitter. I was apalled to look at the amount of screentime I had racked up across just these three apps, and so I'm calling a stop to it. I've removed all three apps from my Phone and iPad, and set screentime to block their sites during the day, in order to make time for goals 1 and 2.

I took a note from [Myke Hurley](https://overcast.fm/+E7b4dW8D0) and have installed Reeder on my phone, falling back to RSS as a way to selectively pick up any news/work-related articles I should be keeping an eye on, without resorting to social media as my main source of news consumption.

I'm hoping I'll see some other benefits from this change, I actually removed the apps a few days ago and have already found my attention span has increased slightly - I even found time to sit and write my goals for 2020.
