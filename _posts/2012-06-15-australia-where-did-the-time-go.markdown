Well it’s official, I’m in Melbourne! The trip was incredible, given I &nbsp;think it’s just about the longest trip you could make from anywhere, it &nbsp;was all very smooth! My first flight from London to Singapore lasted &nbsp;about 12 hours, but was fantastic. I flew on an A380, so there was &nbsp;plenty of room and I’m surprised to say, even the food was good! I had a &nbsp;4 hour layover at Chingai airport, but the place was huge! I spent a &nbsp;good few hours walking around the shops and even had time for a drink &nbsp;and a look around the butterfly house!

By the time I’d finished looking around, it was time to board my &nbsp;final flight to Melbourne. In all, that was also a great flight. It was &nbsp;fairly empty, so I had the benefit of being able to lie down properly, &nbsp;which was wonderful!

Finally, at 6am, I landed in Australia! To start with, it didn’t feel &nbsp;all that different… That said, I hadn’t slept properly for a good &nbsp;couple of days, so it was definitely quite a lot to take in! Since &nbsp;landing, I’ve spent a couple of days in the office, I’ve sorted out a &nbsp;phone, opened a bank account and I’m currently sat in my hotel after &nbsp;having had breakfast, waiting to go and view a house! I’m looking to &nbsp;view/apply for as many places as possible, in the hope of having the &nbsp;best chance of moving in to somewhere fairly quickly, so that when &nbsp;Charleigh and Ellie come over in July, we’re all set to go!
