<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened&hellip; But I recently sold my Macbook Pro, before doing so I spent hours, working through all my music, videos and personal files to ensure that when I formatted the drive, I didn&rsquo;t lose anything.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until some weeks after I sold my MBP that I realised I had not backed up iPhoto. Because of this, I unfortunately lost almost every picture I had taken over the last 4 years, including pictures from my trip to India, Skiing holidays and my travels through the east coast of the states. Needless to say, I was heartbroken.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sworn now, that not a single picture or video I ever take, will be lost to this stupidity. I&rsquo;ve ordered a 2TB NAS drive, to which I will be linking all my computers and mobile devices, to ensure that nothing is ever lost again. I just couldn&rsquo;t handle this happening once more.</p>
