<p>It&rsquo;s been said many times, if you go on holiday you won&rsquo;t have a job to come back to. That&rsquo;s really not so, but the case here is if you go on holiday, you&rsquo;ll wish you hadn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>I have a fairly high workload, I always have&hellip; But that&rsquo;s not for lack of trying hard, it&rsquo;s just the way this industry works. I constantly have an (over capacity) 10 clients, alongside my work helping colleagues, plus general day to day house keeping. So when I miss a day, in this case two, I have to cram 5 days work in to 3, which just doesn&rsquo;t look healthy!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly working evenings and weekends, always learning more and trying new things. But hell, do I hate having time off!</p>
