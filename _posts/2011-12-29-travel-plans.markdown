I recently uploaded the above picture to Instagram, as a view to everywhere I’ve been in 2011. Whilst I’m sure some may find that impressive, for me, I don’t think it really is. I’ve always loved travelling, such as the old saying goes “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey” and I love journeys. You’re able to see so much, places, people, iconic buildings, beautiful scenery, it’s all there to go and see!

In the past 3 years, I’ve been more places than I could have possibly imagined. If I were able to show on a map, I would, but quite frankly, that’s a lot of effort given that the above image would generated automatically by iPhoto… haha.

My plan for 2012 is to see as many new places as possible. My brother and I have already started planning our next european road trip, heading straight for Berlin and moving east from there, so I’m hoping to be able to cover some good ground in that week! On top of that, Charleigh and I are also planning another trip in to Europe, I believe she wants to go back to the Eiffel tower again, but I’m keen to not just cover the same ground as this year. I want to make sure we see something new!

I also have a the prospect of heading out to the states again this year, at the moment it’s not been confirmed, so I won’t divulge any details, but if that’s goes ahead, I’ll be seeing even more sights!!
