<p><img class=" wp-image-371 alignleft" title="Bon Voyage!" src="assets/aa1c1196abe411e1b00112313800c5e4_7-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" />Today certainly marks the end of an era for me&hellip; After almost 3 years of back and forth between the office and home, these are my last few hours in the ChannelAdvisor London office! I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed working here and this is by no means the last time I shall ever visit, but for the next couple of weeks I&rsquo;ll be working from home until I fly out to Australia!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly the move we were hoping for&hellip; Charleigh and Ellie aren&rsquo;t able to come out to Aus for a little while longer, but we&rsquo;re hoping that time flies by!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll miss working in this office&hellip; It&rsquo;s in a lovely place and I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to work with some of the best people on both a personal and a professional level. I&rsquo;ve also been able to learn a lot whilst I&rsquo;ve been here and I really hope I&rsquo;ve been able to give back as much in return.</p>
<p>Just now I was given a card signed by the entire office, usually these kind of things (whilst sad), don&rsquo;t tend to bother me that much, but this time seems to be different.</p>
