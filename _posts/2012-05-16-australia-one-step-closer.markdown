<p>We&rsquo;re not quite there yet&hellip; We&rsquo;ve still a long list of tasks to accomplish before we officially move, but nonetheless as of today, we&rsquo;re one step closer to our move! First thing this morning, I finally, officially, submitted our VISA application! It&rsquo;s taken quite some time to get this far, as we&rsquo;re a &ldquo;De Facto&rdquo; couple, the amount of evidence we need to supply is utterly endless. It&rsquo;s been a strain to be perfectly honest, we&rsquo;ve gone back and forth with our immigration lawyers for weeks, so I&rsquo;m very happy to say that we&rsquo;ve reached the end of the first phase of our move!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not all the way there yet though, first we have to ensure our VISA is approved. Once we get that far, then things will happen very, very quickly&hellip; From a work perspective, I&rsquo;ve pretty much handed over all my accounts, I&rsquo;ve been training some new hires over the past 6 weeks or so and they&rsquo;ve got up to speed very quickly. From a life perspective our &ldquo;To do&rdquo; list looks like this:
<ul /> 
<li>Await VISA approval</li>
<p> 
<li>Book flights</li>
<p> 
<li>Say final goodbyes to friends and family</li>
<p> 
<li>Pack our entire life is to as few suitcases as humanly possible</li>
<p> 
<li>Book a hotel in Melbourne</li>
<p>Once we then land over in the new, promised land:
<ul /> 
<li>Check into hotel</li>
<p> 
<li>Open bank accounts</li>
<p> 
<li>Find new home and move in to said home</li>
<p> 
<li>Find and buy a car</li>
<p> 
<li>Begin our new lives&hellip;</li>
<p>That last step there, is really the most important. The entire list is quite a lot of work, most of it has to be done within a week of landing in Australia, so I envisage it being fairly stressful, but once it&rsquo;s all out of the way and we&rsquo;ve begun to settle, we&rsquo;ve got all the time in the world! I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the silly things, like trips to Ikea to get our first sets of furnishings, making our house a home&hellip; Then, we can enjoy our new lives.</p>
