<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fairly hesitant to write anything about subjects like this, mainly because so many other people do and quite frankly, I just don&rsquo;t want their opinions&hellip;</p>
<p>That said, a friend and I were just discussing the announcement of the new iPhone and this was my response to him.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#39;ve gotta be honest - I am disappointed, but I&#39;m not as disappointed with the phone, so much the poor manor in which they handled the leaks.. If we didn&#39;t know anything 6 weeks ago (As with the launch of the first phone for instance), what we found out would have been a much better presentation... That said, you&#39;re right, the phone is still lacking - But the only way in which I think it&#39;s lesser than lets say the SGS3, is NFC...</p>
<p>Anything else we&#39;re looking at in comparison is pretty much OS based, right? And changes for that are easy to make.. So perhaps it&#39;s not missing out on so much?</p>
<p>I&#39;m blabbering slightly, but also defending a brand and product I love... I will get an iPhone 5, it&#39;s inevitable... But like I say, I also have an HTC One X for work, so what am I missing out on really?</p>
<p>Again - I bought in to the Apple family a long time ago and as a result, my changing from an iPhone to anything else at this point, would render my synchronous world fairly useless... I&#39;m going to buy a Galaxy Nexus tablet and I do have a PC - So I&#39;m not entirely drowned in Apple products.. But, this product launch just wasn&#39;t the same, and I put that down to leadership.</p></blockquote>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s a family of products and comparing one manufacturer of a phone to another is an exercise in futility. If I wanted a Samsung Galaxy, I&rsquo;d get one. I just don&rsquo;t want it. I want my iPhone, my iPad and Macbook Pro and I want the ease of use I&rsquo;ve come to love. I want to not have to worry about syncing devices, keeping OS&#39; up to date, nor do I want to have 4 different operating systems to live with.</p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s decisions in life are aimed at making their lives easier, to allow them to focus on the things that really matter. To me, I couldn&rsquo;t care less that the SGS3 or the new Nokia have NFC - I&rsquo;m really not bothered&hellip; My cards are NFC enabled and that&rsquo;s all that matters. If one day Apple do release a phone with that capability, then great. But for now, who really cares?</p>
