I've seen a few recommendations for this recently as an easy, relatively cheap, super comfortable upgrade to any office chair. I'm still using my Herman Miller Aeron - which is great - but the clanky old wheels had been a minor but constant annoyance now that I'm on a hardwood floor rather than office carpet.

I went for [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/YeMI-Replacement-Castors-Hardwood-Laminate/dp/B07T73S8J2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=YeMI+Set+of+5+Office+Chair+Caster+Wheels+3-Inch+Rubber+Replacement+Castors+Wheels+Safe+for+Hardwood+Floors%2C+Laminate%2C+Carpet%2C+and+Tile%2C11mm+Stem&qid=1607590357&sr=8-1) set of rollerblade style wheels from Amazon and they've been lovely.
