<p>So it may well seem like I&rsquo;m just generally moaning at all public transport, I have to be honest, I am. It&rsquo;s shit. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent years taking buses and trains all over the country, through cities and all across different countries, I can, without a single doubt guarantee that the UK has <strong>the</strong> worst public transport system ever created. </p>
<p>Why are the buses and trains always late? <strong>Get a watch, Germany manage it just fine. </strong></p>
<p>Why are they constantly over crowded? <strong>Get more trains and buses with the money you get from the extortionate rates your charge your customers. </strong></p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to get from one place to another? <strong>I don&rsquo;t want to have to transfer at 6 places via 2 different methods of transport just to get to work on time. </strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly aiming this at TFL (Transport for London). The Olympics are next year and the messaging you&rsquo;re sending out is that everyone in london should add an hour to their commute time. An hour?! I can walk almost anywhere in London in that time, what the fuck? How about you take the £36m (more likely £57m) from United Emirates and build a transport system that doesn&rsquo;t suck? The revenue London is going to see coming in from tourism could easily subsidise the cost of a stupid cable car from Greenwich to Canary warf. I mean, there&rsquo;s already a tunnel connecting those places?!</p>
<p>Seriously, what idiots let our current government control this? Privatise it, maybe it&rsquo;ll become slightly skewed in it&rsquo;s perception of money-making, but hey, it might be like the mail service where everyone will be competing for a cheaper and better service!</p>
