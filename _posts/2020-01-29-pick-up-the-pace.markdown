I've really enjoyed my reading challenge so far this year. I flew through my first 3 books in as many weeks, but hit a stumbling block going in to the 4th. I chose 'War of the Worlds' as my next read, but have struggled immensely with the age if the writing, which has led me to not pick up the book and engage with it as much as the last few.

I've decided to put 'War of the Worlds' on hold and come back to it another time. For now I've opted to start reading 'Wool', the first in a series I've been recommended a number of times.
