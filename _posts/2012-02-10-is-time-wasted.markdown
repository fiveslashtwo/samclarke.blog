<p>I&rsquo;ve always been really good at managing my time, as I described in my last post I have a huge client list, but manage to stay on top of it whilst also helping out other colleagues. Sometimes though, I feel that my time would be better spent on other tasks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently on my way down to London, on the 6:15 train out of Birmingham. From there I will catch the 9:12 Eurostar to Paris and head out for a 1pm meeting. </p>
<p>This is fine by me, it&rsquo;s always worth seeing a client, but I&rsquo;ll have spent the best part of 6 hours travelling this morning, through which I&rsquo;ve been unable to do any work&hellip; This means that by the time I get back home (about midnight) I&rsquo;ll have a day to catch up on. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help that feel, given the industry I work in, face to face client meeting are a slight waste of everyone&rsquo;s time? Maybe we should make better use of Skype or GoTo Meeting?</p>
