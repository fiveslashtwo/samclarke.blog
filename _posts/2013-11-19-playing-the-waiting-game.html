<p>Over this past weekend, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time researching and looking at apartments/houses in Melbourne. I viewed a couple of different apartments on Saturday and then spent a lot of time looking round the different suburbs, even making my way in to the centre of Melbourne to take a look around! After all that, I&rsquo;ve pretty much decided on the area I think we&rsquo;d like to live in so I spent most of Sunday applying to various different estate agents for properties I&rsquo;d like to see and even making applications for a few of them!<!--more--></p>
<p>Now comes the painful part&hellip; Waiting. The place I liked the most has been on the market for around 4 weeks now, without anyone having made an offer - Which I see as a good thing! I made an offer on Saturday after viewing and am really keen to make it our home! The estate agent reckons that my application will be processed today and they&rsquo;ll run through reference checks etc. I&rsquo;m pretty keen to have the application happen as quickly as possible, so as soon as I can, I shall be ringing the agent!</p>
