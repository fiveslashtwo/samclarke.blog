I'm massively guilty of thinking I know a story because I've seen the film. That was one of the things I was aware of when setting myself the goal of ready consistently this year. I was absolutely blown away by how much more there was to this story than the film selected to use as inspiration. Asimov's writing style is incredibly concise which leaves room for massive amounts of narrative in a small space. I loved the neo-futuristic feel to the characters and setting, and how he explored psychology so thoroughly. 10/10.
