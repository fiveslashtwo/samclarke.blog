<p>If you were awake at the ungodly hour of 10:30am (Australian time) today, you may have noticed me frantically tweeting that the wait is finally over.. Charleigh and Ellie&rsquo;s VISAs have been approved!<!--more--></p>
<p>This is the moment we&rsquo;ve been waiting for, for 7 weeks today. Nothing else I&rsquo;ve experienced in life has been quite so difficult or stressful, though the rewards will be truly incredible. We&rsquo;re now hunting for the best/cheapest flights we can find, though inevitably I would imagine this will rely mostly on Charleigh finalising things at home, work etc. and my booking of flights.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost there and I couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased.</p>
