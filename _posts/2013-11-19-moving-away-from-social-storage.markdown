<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a user of many different online services over the years I&rsquo;ve been online, from some of the early social networking tools right the way up to the now more common and much more involved and automatic life-logging services. I&rsquo;d always been a great fan of these kinds of applications, especially those which allowed me to upload, store and share my pictures.</p>
<p>Over the past few years the ways in which we all use these types of sites/applications has exploded. Most of my friends and family went from using these services as infrequent, useful ways of communication to 99% of their lives being distributed online within a matter of months. This had been fantastic (especially in the last couple of years whilst I&rsquo;ve been living in Australia) as ways of sharing where we are, what we&rsquo;re doing and the pictures of those events - All in a domain that was completely separate from time.</p>
<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve begun to take photography much more seriously. It&rsquo;s no longer just something I&rsquo;m using to capture moments, or share things - I&rsquo;m now starting to build out quite the catalog of pictures that I want to keep in a much more personal sense than sharing online.</p>
<p>Whilst I&rsquo;ve found the likes of Instagram &amp; Facebook really useful, there are two very distinct reasons for which I&rsquo;m now beginning to move away from these platforms:</p>
<p><strong>I want to be more selective with what I place online.</strong></p>
<p>What I mean by that is I&rsquo;ve always tended to overuse social networking. Over-sharing of information isn&rsquo;t my major concern here, whilst an issue in it&rsquo;s own right, I see that more as something that I&rsquo;ve always managed to be fairly safe with; I don&rsquo;t post levels of personal information that could possibly endanger myself and certainly don&rsquo;t make myself a target for online fraud.</p>
<p>My use of the term &ldquo;overuse of social network&rdquo; is really aimed towards my photos. I&rsquo;m not the type of Facebook member with 12,000 tagged photos, nor do I post images of ever meal, but I certainly take digital photography for granted and that&rsquo;s leading to something I really want to resolve: The quality of my photos are low because the volume of those picture are high.</p>
<p><strong>I want to own what&rsquo;s mine.</strong></p>
<p>This is a subject that&rsquo;s been written by just about everyone in the last couple of months, so I won&rsquo;t go in to the unnecessary details, but ultimately I don&rsquo;t want to be giving away my personal pictures (being shared for friends &amp; family to see) to anyone who feels they&rsquo;d make a fantastic backdrop on the next advertising campaign of a mid-market upholsterer.</p>
<p>To this extent two things are now happening. I&rsquo;ll no longer be posting quite the amount of pictures that I used to, to the majority of social networks. Instead I&rsquo;ll be using my own site, my own domain, as a place to store the images I feel I want to share, and keeping almost every other image privately.</p>
