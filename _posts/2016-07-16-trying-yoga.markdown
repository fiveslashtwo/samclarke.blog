I've never, as such, been against yoga - But only very recently have I begun to see the benefits of the discipline. After what amounts to only an hour of total practise, I've very quickly changed my opinion and am now looking to make it a part of my everyday routine.

Charleigh has helped me immensely by giving me some starting poses to work on, and the desire to manage a headstand which, given I’m currently struggling with, is giving me the drive to keep practising.

This week has been a slow induction, pulling some muscles in my back and chest encouraged me to take it easy for a few days, but I’m really looking forward to improving and seeing more benefit from calming myself and pushing my body.
