<p>This morning I found myself in an odd predicament, whereby a tweet I posted on the hashtag #MostCommonLies, made it&rsquo;s way to the top of that trending section for the morning. This brought with it an absolute onslaught of tweets; the usual garbage, following requests, &ldquo;wand erection&rdquo; fans&hellip; all sorts. This brings me to wonder, why are people interested in tweets like this? More poignantly, why does a tweet of this nature, bring with it such an influx of spam accounts, masses of retweets and hundreds of follows?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t people interested in decent articles that find themselves floating through our feeds? Is the IQ of the average internet user really that low?</p>
