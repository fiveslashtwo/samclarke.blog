<p>As we draw closer to the day we expect to meet our baby, the list of items I anticipate buying seems to be growing longer by the day. Charleigh has remained fairly aprehensive about the amount of items we&rsquo;ll genuinely need, maintaining a shortlist based on her past experience.</p>

<p>Given the current space in our apartment, or lack thereof, I totally understand why we should be looking to hold back on too many of the bulkier items - That is until we find a larger home to help house our growing family. One thing is for certain however, we&rsquo;re definitely going to need a pram (Read: Buggy, Stroller, Push-chair).</p>
<p>I initially began looking in to prams almost immediately after we found out we were to be expecting our baby. From that moment there were two aspects to our choice that I knew I had to get absolutely spot on:</p>

<h4>Multi-purpose Design</h4>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re looking to save on space in the short term and ultimately to save of money, we needed to make sure that whichever pram we chose would allow to to utilise a car-seat as the bassinet and also allow for adaption to different seats as our baby grows.</p>

<h4>Correct ergonomic height</h4>
<p>Being as I&rsquo;m 6&#39; 2", I didn&rsquo;t want want to be hunched over in agony pushing a chair designed for Charleigh&rsquo;s shorter frame. This is vitally important, since the 10+ hours I spend sat in front of my computer is already far too much for my back to take.</p>
<p>Whittling down the options, taking in to account our &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; - Completely dismissing any product with a bad review, or so much as a safety related product recall during the companies early years, I was eventually left with two choices.</p>
<p>Whilst visually very similar there are a couple of distinct differences between these two prams, ultimately the UppaBaby Vista was <strong>3" taller</strong>, <strong>1.5kg lighter</strong> and <strong>$555 cheaper</strong>. It&rsquo;s a complete no-brainer - It&rsquo;s increased height is a huge advantage for me, the small but important weight difference will be very helpful for Charleigh, and the money saved is more than enough for us to buy a car-seat (Once we have a car, anyway).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I spent so much time working my way through viable options and now I can&rsquo;t wait to have the pram in my hands. It makes the realisation that our baby is almost here, so much clearer!</p>
