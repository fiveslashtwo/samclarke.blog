<p>When we first began planning the move to Australia, Charleigh and I both knew that during the interim, whilst we apart, we&rsquo;d both have to keep pretty busy. Mainly for the sake of sanity, but also to be as effective as possible in the process of getting our move underway.<!--more--></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to say that so far, that seems to be working out really well! So far today I&rsquo;ve viewed 2 different apartments, of which I&rsquo;ve loved both! I&rsquo;ve been invited to an AFL game this afternoon and I&rsquo;ve got plenty of work to get done over the rest of the weekend!</p>
<p>Charleigh seems to be doing fantastically as well and I&rsquo;m so very proud. There&rsquo;s a house viewing back home tomorrow and she&rsquo;s trying to work as much as possible between now and July when she will also be making the big move!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited, I&rsquo;m just really trying to make sure everything is ready for her and Ellie when they arrive! Though, it&rsquo;s pretty certain to say I won&rsquo;t be buying a car in any hurry! The average price of a car over here is insane compared to the UK! I guess that&rsquo;ll just have to stay on my &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo; list for now!</p>
