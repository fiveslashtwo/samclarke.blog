<p>I love time off, who doesn&rsquo;t? But there&rsquo;s always that mammoth task of having to organise everything which is the slight downer on the lead up to your holiday&hellip;</p>
<p>To make matters slightly worse this time, I&rsquo;m out of the office tomorrow for a meeting with a client, which means I&rsquo;ve lost a day which I would have used to prepare my colleagues with some work I need them to do in the meantime and unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve also lost the extra day I had to complete some outstanding work. It won&rsquo;t be a problem, I&rsquo;ve got a lot done already and it&rsquo;s only 11am, which is definitely a bonus! But it just puts a slight bummer on everything.</p>
<p>Aside from the generic work I need to get done in the meantime, I&rsquo;ve also got a lot of personal stuff to get out of the way too&hellip; Printing boarding passes for the tunnel, getting a hard copy of our breakdown cover from the RAC&hellip; Those all stick directly with the trip! Other than that, I&rsquo;ve got to get my suit from our other office and get it back to Greenwich without a suit bag, I&rsquo;ve got to get up to Worcestershire tomorrow for this meeting, Saturday we&rsquo;ve been invited to a wedding and then Sunday I&rsquo;ve got to get back to Worcester to finish packing the car, give it a final service and we&rsquo;re off!</p>
